I'm Abhinav Gupta, and I'm currently pursuing a BTech in Information Technology at Oriental College of Technology in Bhopal.
My academic journey is enriched with a focus on JAVA programming and Cloud Computing. Coding has become more than just a hobby for me it's a genuine fascination that keeps me engaged.
In the realm of leisure, I find solace and adventure within the pages of fiction novels.
